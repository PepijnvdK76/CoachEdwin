        Paragraphs are the building blocks
        of papers. Many students define
        paragraphs in terms of length: a
        paragraph is a group of at least
        five sentences,
    </p>

    <br><br>


    <p>
        a paragraph is half a page long,
        etc. In reality, though, the unity
        and coherence of ideas among
        sentences is what constitutes a
        paragraph.

        A paragraph is defined as “a group
        of sentences or a single sentence
        that forms a unit” (Lunsford and
        Connors 116).

        Length and appearance do not
        determine whether a section in
        a paper is a paragraph.
    </p>

    <br><br>


    <p>
        For instance, in some styles of
        writing, particularly journalistic
        styles, a paragraph can be just
        one sentence long. Ultimately, a
        paragraph is a sentence or group of
        sentences that support one main idea.

        In this handout, we will refer to this
        as the “controlling idea,” because it
        controls what happens in the rest
        of the paragraph.
